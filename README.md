this repository will follow a tiered folder structure which separates individual projects by *expected* difficulty. each project will have a `pyproject.toml` file for use with [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/) and (hopefully) a live demo, as it becomes possible.

## DIRECTORY:

### **01**: easy
- **lad-mibs**: a simple mad-libs style game!
    - status: **active**

### 02: medium
- **terminal-paint**: color mixing fun in the terminal. 
    - status: *planned*

### 03: hard
- (**soon!**)
